'StringJoiner' is a class introduced in Java 8 as part of the 'java.util' package. It is used to construct a sequence of characters separated by a delimiter and optionally starting with a supplied prefix and ending with a supplied suffix.

The 'StringJoiner' class provides several constructors, but the most common one takes a delimiter as an argument:

public StringJoiner(CharSequence delimiter)
