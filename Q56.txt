Encapsulation is a mechanism in Java that allows you to hide the implementation details of a class from the outside world, and to control access to the class's internal state and behavior. In other words, encapsulation provides a way to protect the integrity of the data and methods of a class, and to prevent unauthorized access to them.

Here is an example Java program that demonstrates encapsulation:

Program:
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getters and setters for name and age
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0 && age <= 120) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid age: " + age);
        }
    }
}
