In Java, you can check whether a number is odd or even using the modulo operator (%). The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. If a number is even, then it will be divisible by 2 with no remainder. If a number is odd, then it will not be divisible by 2 with no remainder.

Here's an example code to check if a number is odd or even:
program:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;

        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is even");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is odd");
        }
    }
}
